# International School on Algorand Smart Contracts

Algorand has several distinctive features that make it different from other mainstream blockchain platforms: for instance, the native custom assets, the atomic groups of transactions, the separation between stateless to stateful smart contracts, the concept of local variables, and the TEAL bytecode language. 
All these features can be combined to design complex smart contracts, that can be executed on-chain by the Algorand Virtual Machine. 

The *International School on Algorand Smart Contracts* aims at giving a comprehensive understanding on the development of smart contracts for the Algorand blockchain. The school is organized by [leading scientists](#organising-committee) in the area of blockchain technologies, and it is open to international MSc/PhD students, researchers and practitioners from academia and industry. 

The [school programme](#school-programme) combines theoretical lectures with the practical sessions, and includes a 1-week project development work, with [awards](#developers-projects--awards) for the best projects.

## Developers' projects & awards

In the second week a project on smart contract programming will be assigned to the school participants. Participants will be grouped by the school organizers according to their background and expertise. The groups, composed of 3 students each, will work on the projects offline during the rest of the second and third weeks, also interacting with the school organizers and with the lab tutors. The developed projects will be presented in the last week and will be evaluated by an evaluation committee. 

After the school, participants will submit the code of projects to the Algorand Developers Portal, in the form of articles including an overview of the solution, code snippets, and the link to the full code. Awards will be granted once projects are submitted to the Algorand Developers Portal.

The best three projects will be awarded at the school closing. The amounts of the awards are the following (before taxes):
- 1st prize: 2500 EUR
- 2nd prize: 1500 EUR
- 3rd prize: 1000 EUR
